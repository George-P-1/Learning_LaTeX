# LaTeX

I will be using this repository to record my progress of learning LaTeX. 
This includes:
- Installing LaTeX
    - LaTeX Workshop in VSCode
    - MikTex or TexLive
    - TexStudio or TexMaker (for extra features that may be useful)
- Links to useful information, learning material and guides I found online.

## Links for Research before Installation
The things I looked at to decide what to install, why and how.

    - "I switched to 95% VS Code/5% TexStudio once I got the settings right. The only thing VS Code lacks is the ability to change labels across a project, which TS handles well."
    - "Mostly the lack of extensions that VSCode has to make my coding experience for the most part easier. And lack of some text manipulation features, for example column selection, multiple cursors which I am used to using when coding day to day. I do still use TexStudio a little bit for some niche operations like outline manipulation, label manipulation and table generation."

    - "in TeXstudio, you can draw math symbols with your mouse and have them translated into LaTeX code."

#### Conclusion from Research: 
- VSCode > TeXStudio > TexMaker
- Overleaf good for collaboration with others but same effect achieved with above options and proper git use.
- All local versions need Perl to be installed for full functionality.
- Optional but probably useful extensions available in VSCode.
